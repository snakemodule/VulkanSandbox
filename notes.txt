a pipeline (?) has multiple descriptor sets

a descriptor set has multiple bindings

a binding has a type and a index

ideas:
SbBufferUniform factory


//---------------------

TODO: 22/03
generate lights buffer,
read lights, lightgrid and light indices in compose fragment shader


Log:
27/03:
using linear depth in frag

28/03:
fixed dynamic buffer count, but not completely?

plans for 29/03: start debugging clusters, or try world space clusters first
discovery: lighting goes well outside the range of the light, clusters outside the range of the light seem to be active...
depth slicing used log2 all along!?
different attenuation formula keeps inside radius?

31 inspect tileBuffer 
tilebuffer seems ok so far
discovery: zTile reaches cluster end before far plane?
small success: highlighting depth slice with aabb intersection

it works, with fragment in view space coords,
	try depth.


01: problem when only 1 light, 
solved: misaligned memory in SbUniformBuffer

looking into shadow mapping cube maps.
11: sascha willems shadow omni example
13: remaking renderpass abstractions

clustered shading notes


avalanche:

*do not cluster with normals

culling
*cull against the AABB of the clusters, simple solution.
*Iterative sphere refinement, how? code example in ppt
	*spotlight iterative plane narrowing, no example in ppt, skipping


*light assignment on CPU, example in Emil code, upload to buffer instead of 3d texture.




*many shadow casters requires virtual textures.
	key words?: sparse textures, texture paging?
